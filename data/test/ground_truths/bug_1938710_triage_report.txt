BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938710
Product/Component: Core / Graphics: WebGPU
Status: RESOLVED | Resolution: FIXED
Created: 2024-12-21 04:38 UTC
Summary: [webgpu] https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/remove-background-webgpu appears to be slow around FXC

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P5
- Severity: S3
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Performance regression around FXC path (D3D shader compiler) or pipeline cache; shader translation cost.
- Modules: WebGPU backend, shader caching, DX12 adapter selection.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
4) Profile FXC shader compile path; validate pipeline cache; consider toggling DXC vs FXC.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
