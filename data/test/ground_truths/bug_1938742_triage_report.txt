BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938742
Product/Component: Core / JavaScript Engine: JIT
Status: RESOLVED | Resolution: FIXED
Created: 2024-12-21 07:34 UTC
Summary: [loong64] Assertion failure: cx_->hadResourceExhaustion(), at js/src/jit/WarpOracle.cpp:206

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P4
- Severity: S4
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Architecture-specific assertion/crash in JIT; incorrect guards or simulator behavior on loong64/mips64.
- Modules: WarpOracle / backend simulators; resource exhaustion paths.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
4) Add architecture-specific jit-tests; verify simulator parity; check recent WarpOracle/backend patches.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
