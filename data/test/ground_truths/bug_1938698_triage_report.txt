BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938698
Product/Component: Core / XPCOM
Status: RESOLVED | Resolution: INCOMPLETE
Created: 2024-12-21 00:24 UTC
Summary: Intermittent LeakSanitizer | leak at nsTimer, nsTimer::WithEventTarget, NS_NewTimerWithCallback, NS_NewTimerWithCallback

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P5
- Severity: S4
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- LeakSanitizer indicates reference cycle or timer not cancelled; event targets retaining timers.
- Modules: nsTimer, event target plumbing, shutdown ordering.
- Intermittent suggests race/timing or precision tolerance issues; stabilize with deterministic prefs and explicit waits.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
1) Tag with 'intermittent-failure'; collect logs and screenshot diffs where applicable.
2) Add explicit waits for loads/layout flushes; fix DPR and enable deterministic prefs in test.
3) Reduce flakiness by replacing visual assertions with DOM/geometry checks when possible.
4) Add leak logging on nsTimer destruction; audit cancellation paths and event target ownership.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
