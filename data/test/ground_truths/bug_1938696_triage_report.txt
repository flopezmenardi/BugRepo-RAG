BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938696
Product/Component: Core / SVG
Status: RESOLVED | Resolution: INCOMPLETE
Created: 2024-12-21 00:12 UTC
Summary: Intermittent [tier 2] svg/sizing/standalone--pct-auto--0-px.svg == svg/sizing/pass-pct-px.xhtml | single tracking bug

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P5
- Severity: S4
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Flakiness around percentage/auto sizing resolution; rounding and viewport size timing can differ across platforms.
- Modules: SVG frame classes, percentage length resolution, snapshot comparisons.
- Intermittent suggests race/timing or precision tolerance issues; stabilize with deterministic prefs and explicit waits.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
1) Tag with 'intermittent-failure'; collect logs and screenshot diffs where applicable.
2) Add explicit waits for loads/layout flushes; fix DPR and enable deterministic prefs in test.
3) Reduce flakiness by replacing visual assertions with DOM/geometry checks when possible.
4) Split percentage vs auto cases; assert resolved viewport early; increase fuzz only as last resort.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
