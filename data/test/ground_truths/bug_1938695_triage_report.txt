BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938695
Product/Component: Core / Layout: Images, Video, and HTML Frames
Status: NEW
Created: 2024-12-21 00:02 UTC
Summary: min-height and max-height clamps aren't applied to specified 'height', when resolving min-content width of replaced element

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P3
- Severity: S3
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Likely ordering issue applying min/max block-size clamps before intrinsic sizing of replaced elements.
- Modules: layout reflow pipeline, intrinsic size for replaced elements, aspect-ratio resolution.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
4) Create reduced testcase with replaced element + min/max clamps; verify spec conformance (CSS Sizing).

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
