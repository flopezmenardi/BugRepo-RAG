BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938716
Product/Component: Testing / Talos
Status: RESOLVED | Resolution: INCOMPLETE
Created: 2024-12-21 06:07 UTC
Summary: Intermittent tp5o | Browser Failed to close properly during warmup

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P5
- Severity: S4
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Harness warmup shutdown race; process not closing cleanly on tp5o warmup iteration.
- Modules: Talos runner, process shutdown hooks, profile cleanup.
- Intermittent suggests race/timing or precision tolerance issues; stabilize with deterministic prefs and explicit waits.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
1) Tag with 'intermittent-failure'; collect logs and screenshot diffs where applicable.
2) Add explicit waits for loads/layout flushes; fix DPR and enable deterministic prefs in test.
3) Reduce flakiness by replacing visual assertions with DOM/geometry checks when possible.
4) Add retry/shutdown hooks; ensure child process termination before next warmup iteration.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
