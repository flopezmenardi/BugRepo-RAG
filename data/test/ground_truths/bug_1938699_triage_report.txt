BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938699
Product/Component: Core / JavaScript Engine
Status: RESOLVED | Resolution: INCOMPLETE
Created: 2024-12-21 00:26 UTC
Summary: Intermittent [tier 2] /import-maps/multiple-import-maps/basic.html | single tracking bug

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P5
- Severity: S4
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Import maps interaction; parser/resolution ordering differences causing intermittents.
- Modules: import maps implementation, module loader, WPT harness assumptions.
- Intermittent suggests race/timing or precision tolerance issues; stabilize with deterministic prefs and explicit waits.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
1) Tag with 'intermittent-failure'; collect logs and screenshot diffs where applicable.
2) Add explicit waits for loads/layout flushes; fix DPR and enable deterministic prefs in test.
3) Reduce flakiness by replacing visual assertions with DOM/geometry checks when possible.
4) Add WPT expectations tweaks only after root cause; prefer fixing module loader ordering.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
