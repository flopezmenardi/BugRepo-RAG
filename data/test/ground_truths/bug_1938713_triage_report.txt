BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938713
Product/Component: Core / DOM: Core & HTML
Status: REOPENED
Created: 2024-12-21 05:56 UTC
Summary: Intermittent /html/semantics/embedded-content/the-iframe-element/sandbox-top-navigation-grandchild-allow-same-origin.tentative.sub.window.html | single tracking bug

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P5
- Severity: S4
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Sandbox navigation policy handling across same-origin grandchild iframes; feature policy/sandbox flags interplay.
- Modules: docshell/navigation, window.open/top navigation restrictions.
- Intermittent suggests race/timing or precision tolerance issues; stabilize with deterministic prefs and explicit waits.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
1) Tag with 'intermittent-failure'; collect logs and screenshot diffs where applicable.
2) Add explicit waits for loads/layout flushes; fix DPR and enable deterministic prefs in test.
3) Reduce flakiness by replacing visual assertions with DOM/geometry checks when possible.
4) Add tests for sandbox flag combinations and top-navigation; confirm policy per spec.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
