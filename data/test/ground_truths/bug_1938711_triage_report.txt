BUG TRIAGE REPORT
------------------
Bug ID: 1938711
Product/Component: Core / Panning and Zooming
Status: RESOLVED | Resolution: INCOMPLETE
Created: 2024-12-21 04:57 UTC
Summary: Intermittent gfx/layers/apz/test/mochitest/test_group_double_tap_zoom-2.html | single tracking bug

FIELD PREDICTIONS
- Priority: P5
- Severity: S4
- Classification: Components
- Platform: All

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- APZ timing/gesture detection instability; device scale and double-tap thresholds vary.
- Modules: APZ controller, async pan/zoom state machine.
- Intermittent suggests race/timing or precision tolerance issues; stabilize with deterministic prefs and explicit waits.

TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
1) Tag with 'intermittent-failure'; collect logs and screenshot diffs where applicable.
2) Add explicit waits for loads/layout flushes; fix DPR and enable deterministic prefs in test.
3) Reduce flakiness by replacing visual assertions with DOM/geometry checks when possible.

NOTES
- Predictions are heuristic based on component, product, and summary patterns (e.g., intermittent tests vs. user-visible regressions).
- Revisit Priority/Severity once a reproducer/impact is confirmed.
