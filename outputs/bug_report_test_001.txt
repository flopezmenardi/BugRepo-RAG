LLM Generated Guidance
----------------------
**FIELD PREDICTIONS**:
- Priority: P2 (High) based on majority of similar bugs (P5, P5, P2).
- Severity: S3 (Major) based on majority of similar bugs (S4, N/A, S3).
- Platform: Desktop, as it is the most common platform among similar bugs.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
- The issue of browser crashes when handling large files with complex interactions is reminiscent of bugs related to memory management, resource handling, or script execution inefficiencies.
- Bug 1957455, involving a content process crash related to session restore, may indicate potential issues with handling large amounts of data or complex session information.
- Bug 1959912, where Firefox becomes unresponsive after uploading a big folder, could suggest a similar issue with handling large amounts of data causing performance degradation.
- Bug 1986833, an intermittent browser process crash related to the new tab page, may hint at instability in handling certain types of content or interactions.

**TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS**:
1. Investigate memory management and resource handling mechanisms when dealing with large files and complex JavaScript interactions.
2. Analyze the impact of uploading large amounts of data on browser performance and responsiveness.
3. Consider optimizing script execution and data processing to prevent browser crashes in scenarios involving complex interactions.
4. Test the scenario with different file sizes and interaction patterns to identify specific triggers for the crash.
